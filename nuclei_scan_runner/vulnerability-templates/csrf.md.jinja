# Description
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing.

# Impact 
A successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state-changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address etc.

# Steps to reproduce 
- #TODO - triager will write this.

# Remediation
Implement protections described in the Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet [3], for instance:
- Do not use GET requests for state-changing operations.
- Use unique CSRF tokens.
