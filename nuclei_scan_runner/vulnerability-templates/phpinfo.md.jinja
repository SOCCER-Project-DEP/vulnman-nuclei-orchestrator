# Description
phpinfo() is a debug functionality that prints out detailed information on both the system and the PHP configuration.

# Impact 
An attacker can obtain information such as:
- Exact PHP version.
- Exact OS and its version.
- Details of the PHP configuration.
- PHP compilation options
- PHP extensions
- Internal IP addresses.
- Server environment variables.
- Loaded PHP extensions and their configurations.
- HTTP headers

This information can help an attacker gain more information on the system, which can be used to further exploit the system.
