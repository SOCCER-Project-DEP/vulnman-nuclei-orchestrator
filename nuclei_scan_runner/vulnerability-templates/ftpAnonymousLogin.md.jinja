# Description
FTP anonymous login allows users to log in to your FTP server without credentials. This is the default configuration on some FTP servers and it could lead to unauthorized access to private information.
# Impact 
This vulnerability could lead to stealing sensitive information, files, credentials, etc.

# Steps to reproduce
1. Use `ftp Anonymous@{{ payload_evidence }}`

# Remediation
- We suggest turning off anonymous login if it is not expected behaviour.
