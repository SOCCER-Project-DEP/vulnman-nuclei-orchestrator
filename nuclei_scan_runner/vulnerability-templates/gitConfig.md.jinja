# Description
A .git folder contains essential information about projects, such as remote repository addresses, commit history logs and other essential metadata. Leaving this data in open access can lead to breaches and system exposure.

# Impact 
If the git repo is not publicly available, the exposed .git folder leads to code disclosure. It can contain files with hardcoded credentials, private keys and other sensitive information.

# Steps to reproduce
1. Visit {{ payload_evidence }}
2. To download .git repo from the site, use the following command:
```BASH
git-dumper http://{{ domain }}/.git extractedGitFolder
```
3. All files from the .git folder should be present at extractedGitFolder

# Remediation
- Delete the .git folder from the server or at least block access to it and its following subfolders.
- Avoid inserting hardcoded sensitive data into the source code.
